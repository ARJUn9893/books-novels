                <h2>#2::NETAJI SUBHASH CHANDRA BOSE</h2>
            </div>

            The book tells the reader how after Second World War, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the tallest Indian freedom
            fighter, slowly petered out in captivity in former Soviet Union, while Kremlin, taking full military
            advantage of Bose's presence in their land created fear in American and British political and military
            strategists and among the post-Independence Indian politicians. The research has also been an outcome of
            British and Indian Government documents and long interviews with senior Indian political leaders. The book
            is extremely sensitive as the stakeholders are not only big global powers, but the unresolved issue involves
            the Indian Government which puts a lid on the mystery by sticking to the fake air crash story in 1945 in
            Taiwan. It is bound to stir up a lot of heat with scholars - especially among, the British, Indian and
            American, besides exposing the role of the Russians, Indian Communists and the Nehru family that still heads
            the Congress now

                <h2>#4::THE 3 MISTAKES OF LIFE</h2>
            </div>

            The 3 Mistakes of my life is the third novel written by eminent Indian Author Chetan Bhagat. Based on
            cricket, business and religion, the novel is set against the backdrop of beautiful city Ahmedabad. Revolving
            around three young Indian boys Omi, Ishaan and Govind, the book goes on to narrate how the three are trying
            their best to make ends meet in the city.

            Based on real events, the book starts with a dramatic twist, where Bhagat is reading an e-mail sent by some
            young person Govind, who has consumed sleeping pills for some reason and is writing to Bhagat, while waiting
            for his life to end. This book revolves around the three major mistakes committed by Govind in his life; he
            also happens to be the central character of the novel.

            Govind dreams to be a successful businessperson, while his friend Ishaan loves cricket and with the help of
            Omi and his priest parents, they set up their first venture - a sports accessories’ shop in a rented place
            outside the temple premises.

                <h2>#5::HALF GIRLFRIEND</h2>
            </div>

            Half Girlfriend is a story of Bihari boy Madhav, a Hindi speaking Bihari who falls in love with Riya, an
            influential Delhi girl on the campus of prestigious St. Stephen’s College. Madhav belongs to middle class
            family, while Riya is from higher class and both have different lifestyles. Madhav proposes her, but Riya
            rejects the proposal because she thinks they are good as a friend only.

            A romance novel for the young adults, Half Girlfriend is a story that has been set in different locations
            including Bihar, Delhi and New York; it revolves around a boy who comes from Bihar in India and his deep
            longing to dazzle out the girl he is in love with.

            According to the author, the book is meant for the "non-English-types" and reveals the utter dissatisfaction
            and language problems a young man from Bihar, who speaks Bhojpuri and knows little about the ways of big
            cities, had to wade through as he got admitted at St. Stephen’s College in the national capital, a place
            that signified sophistication. He falls for a rich, smart and high-class girl from the city. Although the
            girl never fully accepts this relationship, she nevertheless gives a nod to be his "half girlfriend".
